### 🧑‍💻 **Exercises**  
1. **Encapsulation**  
   - **`Car.java`**:  
     A demonstration of encapsulation, using private variables and public getter/setter methods to manage a car's attributes like brand, model, and color.  

2. **Exercise Set 01**  
   - **`Escseq.java`**:  
     Learn how to use escape sequences like `\n` for newlines and `\t` for tabs to create well-structured outputs.  
   - **`Tempconvert.java`**:  
     Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit interactively.  
   - **`Welcome.java`**:  
     A beginner-friendly program to greet users with a warm welcome message.

### 🔬 **Laboratory Activities**  
#### **Lab Activity 1 – *02 September 2024***  
- **`GettingGreater.java`**:  
  - A simple program that accepts two numbers and determines which is greater.  
  - Great for learning conditional statements and user input handling!  
- **`GettingInputs.java`**:  
  - A friendly program demonstrating how to capture user input and display customized results.  
- **Output Screenshots**:  
  - Screenshots included: `GettingGreater_output.png` and `GettingInputs_output.png`, showcasing the results of the programs in action.

#### **Lab Activity 2 – *30 September 2024***  
- **`GetArrayMean.java`**:  
  - Input an array of numbers, calculate their mean (average), and display the result.  
  - A great way to practice array manipulation and basic statistics in Java!  
- **`MultiplicationTable.java`**:  
  - Enter a number, and the program generates a complete multiplication table for it.  
  - Perfect for understanding nested loops and dynamic outputs.  
- **Output Screenshots**:  
  - See the programs in action with files like `GetArrayMean_output.png` and `MultiplicationTable_output.png`.

#### **Lab Activity 4 – *25 November 2024***  
- **Shapes Folder**:  
  - A hands-on exploration of geometry using OOP principles!  
  - **Key Features**:  
    - **Shape Classes**: Includes classes for `Triangle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle`, each encapsulating their own properties.  
    - **Polymorphism**: Implements a polymorphic `displayDetails()` method to output unique details for each shape (area, perimeter).  
    - **Reusability**: Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding for efficient code reuse.
